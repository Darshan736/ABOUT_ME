👋 Hi, I’m Darshan

🎓 1st-Year Engineering Student (VTU)
💻 Learning Programming, Automation & AI Fundamentals

I’m currently focused on building strong programming foundations while exploring AI agents and automation at a beginner level.

🔧 Technical Skills (In Progress)

Programming: Python, C

Automation: n8n (workflow automation)

AI Concepts: Prompt engineering, generative AI basics

Tools: Git, GitHub, Linux basics

🏅 Google Skill Badges & Certifications

I’ve completed the following verified Google Skills badges, which involved hands-on labs and assessments.

Prompt Engineering for Generative AI

These badges represent learning milestones, not expertise. I actively apply these concepts in small projects and automations.

📂 Projects

n8n-Agents
Automation workflows built using n8n for simple AI-assisted tasks.

Research Agent (Learning Project)
A Python-based research assistant created to understand agent logic, tools, and workflows.

Python Mini Projects
Small CLI-based programs to strengthen logic and core Python skills.

🎯 Current Focus

Strengthening Python fundamentals

Writing clean, readable code

Building small but complete projects

Gradually moving towards AI agents with real understanding

🚀 Goals

Become confident in core programming by the end of 1st year

Build real, non-copy-paste projects

Learn ML & LangChain in later semesters

Prepare for AI-focused internships in future years
